## Files and Dataset

We have 3 main files in this repository:

1. `gemma_annotation.csv` -> the original dataset file given by the professor
2. `gemma_annotation_normalized.csv` -> the one we produce after processing original file
   in task 1
3. `failed_extracts_final.csv` -> the final file after querying the LLM to preprocess and testing with the API to reduce number of unknown ingredients
