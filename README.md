Lab for Natural Language Engineering, Assignment 1

Task 1 is obtaining structured data from unstructured data. We are
provided with `ingridient` and `quantity`. We need to normailze all
quantities in standard units (i.e. liters, grams, pieces)

For example, we have:

| ingredient    | amount    |
|------         | -----     |
| paprika       | 1 stück   |
| zucker        | 0.5 tl    |

> tl = table spoon
